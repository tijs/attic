# Architecture

Attic reads the macOS Photos library, exports original files via a companion
Swift tool, and uploads them to S3 with rich metadata. A local manifest tracks
progress so runs are incremental.

## System overview

```
Photos.sqlite ──→ reader.ts ──→ PhotoAsset[] ──→ backup pipeline
                   (read-only)                        │
                                                      ├─→ ladder (Swift subprocess)
                                                      │     exports originals to staging/
                                                      │
                                                      ├─→ S3 upload (original + metadata JSON)
                                                      │
                                                      └─→ manifest.json (on S3, shared across machines)
```

Attic never modifies Photos.sqlite. The database is opened read-only.

## Reading the Photos library

`reader.ts` queries Photos.sqlite in two stages:

**Main query** — a single SELECT joining `ZASSET` and
`ZADDITIONALASSETATTRIBUTES` returns core fields: UUID, filename, date,
dimensions, GPS, file size, UTI, favorite status, cloud state. Trashed assets
are excluded.

**Enrichment queries** — seven independent queries each build a `Map` keyed by
asset primary key (Z_PK). During row mapping, each asset is enriched from these
maps with a default of `null` or `[]` if no match exists.

| Query              | Source tables                                             | Returns                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Descriptions       | `ZASSETDESCRIPTION` → `ZADDITIONALASSETATTRIBUTES`        | `Map<number, string>`      |
| Albums             | `ZGENERICALBUM` → `Z_33ASSETS`                            | `Map<number, AlbumRef[]>`  |
| Keywords           | `ZKEYWORD` → `Z_1KEYWORDS` → `ZADDITIONALASSETATTRIBUTES` | `Map<number, string[]>`    |
| People             | `ZPERSON` → `ZDETECTEDFACE`                               | `Map<number, PersonRef[]>` |
| Edits              | `ZUNMANAGEDADJUSTMENT` → `ZADDITIONALASSETATTRIBUTES`     | `Map<number, EditInfo>`    |
| Rendered resources | `ZINTERNALRESOURCE` (resource type 1)                     | `Set<number>`              |

All enrichment queries go through `safeQuery()`, which catches "no such table"
errors silently and logs other failures. This makes the reader resilient across
macOS versions where table schemas may differ.

People are deduplicated per asset — a person appears at most once even if
detected in multiple face regions.

### Edit detection

An asset is considered edited (`hasEdit: true`) only when two conditions are
met:

1. An entry exists in `ZUNMANAGEDADJUSTMENT` (an edit was performed)
2. An entry exists in `ZINTERNALRESOURCE` with resource type 1 (a rendered file
   was produced)

This distinguishes visual edits from metadata-only adjustments that don't
produce a visible render. When `hasEdit` is false, `editedAt` and `editor` are
both null.

## The backup pipeline

`backup.ts` orchestrates the full flow: filter → batch → export → upload →
manifest.

### 1. Filter

Assets are filtered against the manifest to find pending work. Optional filters
narrow by type (`--type photo|video`) or count (`--limit N`). Dry run mode stops
here.

### 2. Batch and export

Pending assets are processed in batches (default 50). Each batch is sent to
**ladder**, a companion Swift binary that uses PhotoKit to export original
files. Communication is via JSON over stdin/stdout:

```
attic → stdin:  { "uuids": ["UUID/L0/001", ...], "stagingDir": "/path" }
ladder → stdout: { "results": [...], "errors": [...] }
```

Each result includes the file path, size, and SHA-256 hash. PhotoKit identifiers
use the `UUID/L0/001` format; attic strips the suffix before further processing.
Ladder output is validated at the trust boundary with
`assertExportBatchResult()`.

### 3. Upload

For each exported file, attic:

1. Reads the staged file from disk
2. Uploads the original to `originals/{year}/{month}/{uuid}.{ext}`
3. Builds and uploads a metadata JSON to `metadata/assets/{uuid}.json` (see
   `docs/metadata.md`)
4. Updates the in-memory manifest
5. Cleans up the staged file

S3 keys are built from UUID and extension, both validated with regex
(`/^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$/` and `/^[a-z0-9]+$/`) to prevent path traversal.
Extensions are resolved from the asset's UTI via a lookup table, falling back to
the filename extension.

### 4. Manifest

The manifest is stored on S3 at `manifest.json` in the bucket root, mapping UUID
to `{ s3Key, checksum, backedUpAt }`. S3 is the single source of truth — there
is no local manifest file. This enables cross-machine and cross-app (CLI ↔ menu
bar app) continuity.

On backup start, the manifest is downloaded from S3. It's saved back to S3
periodically (every 50 assets by default) for crash resilience, and always at
the end of a run.

**Migration**: existing local manifests at `~/.attic/manifest.json` are
automatically uploaded to S3 on first run via `loadManifestWithMigration()`.

The manifest can be reconstructed from S3 via `verify --rebuild-manifest`, which
reads every `metadata/assets/*.json` file and validates UUID format, S3 key
pattern, and checksum format before accepting an entry.

## Verification

`verify.ts` checks backup integrity in two modes:

- **Quick** (default) — HEAD each S3 key in the manifest, confirm it exists
- **Deep** — download each object, compute SHA-256, compare to the manifest
  checksum

Both modes use a bounded concurrency pool (default 50 workers). Errors are
capped at 1,000 to prevent unbounded memory growth.

## Configuration

Attic reads its configuration from `~/.attic/config.json`. The config file
specifies the S3 endpoint, region, bucket, path-style preference, and Keychain
service names. It's created by `attic init` or manually.

`scan` works without config (it only reads Photos.sqlite). All other commands
(`status`, `backup`, `verify`, `refresh-metadata`) require config and S3
credentials since the manifest is stored on S3.

## Credentials

S3 credentials are stored in the macOS Keychain under configurable service names
(defaults: `attic-s3-access-key` and `attic-s3-secret-key`). They are read at
runtime via `security find-generic-password` — never stored in env vars, config
files, or code.

## Interfaces and testability

All external dependencies are behind interfaces:

| Interface        | Real implementation                           | Mock                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `S3Provider`     | AWS SDK client for any S3-compatible endpoint | In-memory `Map<string, Uint8Array>`        |
| `Exporter`       | Ladder subprocess                             | Returns pre-configured assets from a `Map` |
| `ManifestStore`  | S3-backed JSON (`manifest.json` in bucket)    | Same S3 mock used for uploads              |
| `PhotosDbReader` | SQLite reader for Photos.sqlite               | In-memory SQLite with test fixtures        |

Tests never hit external services, credentials, or the real Photos library.

## What attic doesn't do

- **Modify Photos.sqlite** — read-only access, always
- **Download from iCloud** — relies on Photos having local copies of originals
- **Delete from S3** — the backup is append-only; there is no prune or cleanup
  command
- **Back up thumbnails** — only original files and metadata
- **Back up adjustment plists** — Apple's edit recipes are not portable
- **Back up rendered edits** — detecting edits is implemented (Phase 1);
  exporting and uploading rendered versions is planned (Phase 2/3, see
  `docs/plans/2026-03-13-feat-backup-rendered-edits-plan.md`)
- **Handle slo-mo or Live Photos specially** — these have unique resource types
  that need dedicated investigation
- **Run on non-macOS** — depends on Photos.sqlite, Keychain, and PhotoKit via
  ladder
